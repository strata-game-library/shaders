# 🌿 Strata PR Workflow

## Creating Pull Requests

1. **Keep it Small** - One feature or fix per PR.
2. **Conventional Commits**:
   - `feat(core): add terrain collision`
   - `fix(shaders): resolve water transparency bug`
   - `docs: update API reference`
3. **Draft First** - Start as a draft if not ready for review.

## AI Review Trigger

Request AI review by mentioning `@claude` or using `/cursor review` in comments.

## Merging

1. Ensure **CI** passes.
2. Get at least one human or AI approval.
3. Squash and merge to keep `main` history clean.
