# 🧠 Strata Memory Bank

The Memory Bank is the source of truth for the project's state.

## Core Files

1. `productContext.md`: Purpose and user experience.
2. `activeContext.md`: Current focus and recent changes.
3. `progress.md`: What's done and what's next.
4. `decisionLog.md`: Why we made certain technical choices.

## Update Frequency

1. **Start of Session**: Read `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.
2. **After Significant Changes**: Update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.
3. **End of Session**: Summarize progress and set the next session's context.

## Rules

- Never delete the memory bank.
- Keep it concise but comprehensive.
- Use it to hand off context between AI sessions.
